# LCD_Clock_Temp_Display

## Objective
The goal of this project was to design and implement a fully functional time and temperature display using an F401RE microcontroller board and a 16x2 LCD display. This project affords students an opportunity to learn about general purpose inputs and outputs (GPIO), analog to digital signal conversion, keypad scanning algorithms, and LCD driver implementation.
